# Appartment-On-Rent
A simple responsive website is developed using HTML and CSS(including Media Queries).
A good combination of colours and images gives an attractive look to the website.
The main focus of this project was to create a good User Interface.
We can move move to specific part of the page by clicking on the links in the navigation bar like "Home", "services", "About" and "Contact Us".
